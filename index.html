    There do not seem to be any artefacts specifically crafted for women but men were given weapons and drinking cups to emphasize their status as warriors and hunters. Similarly men were portrayed in violent scenes and alongside wild animals in the iconography of the funerary offerings of the Shaft Graves. One example of this is the ‘Siege Rhyton’ from Grace Circle A. It depicts a battle scene where men take the center change, fighting, and women are in the background wailing. The men are depicted according to a heroic ideal while the women a featured in a marginal and ritualistic role.
